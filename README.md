# Serialised Data Structures
Unity doesn't serialise many data structures like queues and stacks. It is an absolute pain when you need to debug but Unity just won't display them in the inspector.  
This tool added a **serialised queue**, **stack**, even **priority queue** and **tuple** that will finally display in the inspector.
