# Serialised Data Structures
Unity has been lacking support for many collections like queues and stacks. It is an absolute pain when you need to debug but Unity just won't display them in the inspector. This tool added a **serialised queue**, **stack** and **tuple**, and if you purchase the Full Pack, even **priority queue**, **hash set**, **dictionaries** and **binary search tree"" that will finally display in the inspector. <br><br>
See this [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLfByE3Yo_sowjQmRcUBoNlm21xxo65oh9V5NpiQCHQ/edit?tab=t.0) to learn more about them. <br><br>
