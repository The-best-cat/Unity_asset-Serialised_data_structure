# Serialised Data Structures
Unity doesn't serialise many data structures like queues and stacks. It is an absolute pain when you need to debug but Unity just won't display them in the inspector. This tool added a **serialised queue**, **stack**, even **priority queue** and **tuple** that will finally display in the inspector. <br><br>
There are really well made serialised dictionary assets out there so I recommend using theirs if you want serialised dictionaries. My first recommendation is definitely [this one](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/serialized-dictionary-243052).
