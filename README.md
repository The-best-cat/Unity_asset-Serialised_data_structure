# Serialised Data Structures
Unity has been lacking support for many collections like queues and stacks. It is an absolute pain when you need to debug but Unity just won't display them in the inspector. This tool added a **serialised queue**, **stack** and **tuple**, even **priority queue**, **hash set** and **dictionary** that will finally display in the inspector. <br><br>
